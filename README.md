# oldskie-plugin-library
Personal plugin library for compatible DAWs, tailored to meet my personal workflow preferences when producing/mixing music. Try the plugins out for yourself if you have a DAW that supports VST3 or AU (in development). These plugins where built in C++ on the JUCE framework - cheers to them! 

COMMIT NOTES, 02/28/24:
-Deployed first plugin, MONOME! Currently only available in VST3, working to port project over to XCODE to be able to build AU version.
